Notes for the NFT Collection

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Ownable.sol is an openZeppelin contract that is an extension for the ERC-721 
    format, and it helps us to
    - transferOwnership
        - We can transfer the ownership from one address to a new address.
    - renounceOwnership
        - This helps us to relinquish the administrative priveledge, 
            a common pattern after an initial stage when centralized administration 
            is over.
- ERC-721 Enumerable
    - This is an extension of the ERC-721 standard,
        This extension adds some more functionality.
    - totalSupply()
        - Returns the total amount of tokens stored by the contract.
            - Total number of NFTs managed by the contract.
    - tokenOfOwnerByIndex()
        - The onwer is going to have multiple NFTs, it will return the
        index ??????
    - tokenByIndex 
    - Enumerable helps us keep track of all the tokenIds in the contract 
        and also the token ids held by an address for a given contract.

export default function handler(req, res) {
    const tokenId = req.query.tokenId;

    res.status(200).json({
        tokenId: tokenId,
    })
}

}


export default function handler(req, res) {
- export default function is a JS export file that allows us with this code to export this function into
    other programs for their use (in this case, we're using it to link our tokenIds with our NFT metadata)
    (req, res)
        - (request, response)
- handler is the term defining this code above, this code handles API requests and handles responses.

const tokenId = req.query.tokenId;
    - request.query.token.
res.status(200)
    - res.status stands for an http response status, 200 means success.
    - .json stans for the response data format.
        It will respond with:
            - tokenId: tokenId.
