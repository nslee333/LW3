This file was created while following a tutorial on how to use the Mocha/Chai testing frameworks.

You can follow this article here.

A few thing to note:

- I changed the name of the test from the tutorial from 'appTest.js' to just 'test.js'.
    - The reason for this is that my appTest.js file wasn't being read by Mocha, and was throwing an error, so I renamed it to 'test.js' for it to work properly.

- I also ran 'npm init' in the root directory - so I'm not sure if I needed to do that or not

- Installation:
    - npm install --save-dev mocha 
    - npm install --save-dev chai
- Cmds:
    - 'npm run test' for running the test.js script.
