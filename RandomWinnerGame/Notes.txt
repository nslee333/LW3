This project is pretty straight forward. 

This project is basically a lottery game. 

Smart contract keeps track of the game, the players, etc.

The smart contract will use the Chainlink VRF for executing a randomness for our lottery part of our game.

The smart contract has numerous events which the Graph will use to log all the events and keep track of the game.

We then use the graph to log all the events onto our application. 

We then created a subgraph for our random winner game. 

On our application side of the game, we use AXIOS (promise based HTTP clinent) to which we'll query the subgraph that we created for our game.

With AXIOS we pass in our query which is written in GraphQL. 

With our application we can start the game, and join the game, and it will log all the events to our application.
