Alright this is going to be long winded but here it goes.

I've been reviewing solving equations to understand implementing the Uniswap X*Y=K formula.

(X + XΔ) * (Y - YΔ) = K

This equation makes sense to me but I was working on converting the formula and solving for the YΔ.

YΔ = (Y * XΔ) / (X + XΔ)

The ' / (X + XΔ)' part makes sense to me since when we want to convert to solve for YΔ, we have to divide (X + XΔ) by both sides to eliminate (X + XΔ) 
	from the left side of the equation like below.

[(X + XΔ) *] (Y - YΔ) = K
[ / (X + XΔ] 		    [ / (X + XΔ)]

After being divided by both sides, the equation becomes this:

(Y - YΔ) = ? / (X + XΔ)

Then in order to isolate YΔ, we add Y to both sides.
