Hey there, this is my code Walkthrough of the code that's in this file.

I'm doing this for my own learning as well as anyone who is reading this, I try to 
explain the concepts / code that I don't understand to myself in this txt file.

Typicall I have the Txt file on the right side of the screen in VS code, with the source
code on the left side.

The format for the txt file is:

Code that I'm explaining
    - General idea of the code.
    - The syntax if I can find the documentation for it.
    - Any other things I'm not sure about.
If there is any code I have explained before I'll list it, then say that I understand what its 
doing.
