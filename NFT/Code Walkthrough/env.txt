Code Walkthrough of the .env file in this NFT project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

For security reasons its not good to post actual API keys and private keys 
everywhere you might need it in your application.

The issue is that you might accidentally push it to github then, with bots scraping github
all the time, someone could pick up your credentials and then drain your account or 
take control of your node.


This security reason is why we use environment variables, the way that you typically use
environement variables is with a .env file.

In the .env file we define our environment variables, and then we
tell git to ignore this file using the .gitignore file. 

With putting this file in your .gitignore file you now are much more
secure than you were.


ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL="https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/HkE7dutUf0DVRmrLzJjuY1a9vy0geEe5"
    - This is an environment variable, which is only defined here.
        - Instead of posting the full url wherever you need it, all you
        have to do is list the variable.
        - This limits the possible security issues down to one file, making
        it easier to keep track of.


RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY="21f403710983007ef8d352c3c92c97f82443a4c921e7771cdc9ea5bded2cdd1c"
    - Environement variable for your private key.
