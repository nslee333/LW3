This is my code walkthrough for the constants/index.js file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the pages folder under index.js, in order to interact and get values from a contract we 
need to create a new instance of that contract.

Since this is a NFT whitelist Dapp, our index.js page needs to be able to interact with the
Whitelist.sol contract.

This is an example of a function using the constants for the index.js folder.


const checkIfAddressIsWhitelisted = async() => {
    try {

        const signer = getProviderOrSigner(true);
        // This is returning the signer instead of the provider.
        const whitelistContract = new Contract {
            WHITELIST_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
            abi,
            signer,
        }

            
    } catch(err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
}


In order to create an instance of the contract we need three inputs.
    - The contract interface (abi).
    - The contract's address.

In this constants/index.js folder we have assigned variables to our ABI and our address that 
way we can just input the variables in our new contract instaniation without including the whole ABI in
our function.
