Code walkthrough of the index.js script in this Whitelist Dapp - 
Application side. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

In this page we're going to use the React.js library and React Hooks in this page.

React Hooks is one of the main things we'll be using in this file.

'import Head from "next/head";
import Image from 'next/image'
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css";
'
- These are all import statements for specific depenedencies that we're going to be 
    using.
'import Head from next/head;'
    - This is importing the Head component from the next.js library.
    - the Head is a component that allows us to append elements to the head of the 
        page.
'import Image from'next/image''
    - This is importing the Image component from Next.js.
    - The Image component is an extenstion of the HTML <img> element, 
        which includes some optimizations to help achieve good Core Web Vitals.
