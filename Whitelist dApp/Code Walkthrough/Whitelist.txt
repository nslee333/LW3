Code Walkthrough of the Whitelist contract in this Whitelist project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


uint8 public maxWhitelistedAddresses;
    - State variable for the maximum number of addresses that can
        be whitelisted.
    - uint8 is used to reduce storage amount which reduces contract deployment cost 
        since the number dosen't need to be huge.
    - uint8 in solidity's initial value is zero so it dosen't need to be initialized.
  

uint8 public numAddressesWhitelisted;
    - Current number of addresses whitelisted.
    - 

mapping(address => bool) public whitelistedAddresses;
    - Key value data structure mapping to keep track of whitelisted addresses.







constructor(uint8 _maxWhitelistedAddresses) {
    maxWhitelistedAddresses = _maxWhitelistedAddresses;
}
    - constructor function that is setting the maximum number of whitelisted
        addresses.
